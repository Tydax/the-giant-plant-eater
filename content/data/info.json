It offers a place to be creative and provides familiarity. It evokes memories and plays an important role of celebration with others.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">My own journey for cooking started as a child, where I would eagerly watch my mum in her domain preparing food for us all. As those early years moved on, I would take time to watch tv chefs or buy cookery books, allowing my knowledge to grow. Recently, I have moved towards learning about plant-based dishes and I am loving discovering how satisfying a vegan diet can be.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The cooking now takes place in a compact kitchen of a traditional Edinburgh flat. The small space serves me well, allowing me to prepare dishes and bring the joy of food to others.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I call myself a Giant Plant Eater, who has a go and takes inspiration from their partner and the online world. I am mostly vegan and openly proud of it.</p>",
