title: 'Frozen French Onion Soup '
author: Graham

---
_At the start of lockdown, I bought a bag of frozen onions. They lived happily at the bottom of the freezer. I recently defrosted the freezer and removed the mini iceberg that was slowly forming. It was good excuse to use the onions and make soupe a l'oignon. The recipe below is a vegan twist on the French classic. The soup will keep for a few days in a sealed container in the fridge and freezes easily. If you use fresh onions, then chop then finely and sauté them in some oil over a low heat with some brown sugar for a good while before adding the wine and flavoured stock. The advantage of fresh onions is that they easily caramelise and add depth to the flavour. For the crouton, choose a vegan cheeze that melts easily._

**_Serves 3-4_**

**_Preparation: 10 minutes_**

**_Cooking: 20 – 30 minutes_**

**_Ingredients for the Soup_**

_550g of frozen sliced onions_

_800 ml – 1 litre of vegan stock_

_1 glass of vegan red wine_

_1 tbsp of soy sauce_

_1 tsp of marmite_

_1 tbsp of oil_

_2 cloves of garlic, crushed_

_Salt and pepper to season_

**_Ingredients for Cheezy Crouton_**

_3-4 thick slices of rustic bread such as baguette or sourdough_

_I clove of garlic_

_30g of grated vegan cheeze_

_1 tsp of dried mixed herbs or parsley_

**_Method:_**

_Heat the oil in a pan and add in the garlic to fry gently. Next add in the frozen onions and stir through. The onions will release some water as you stir them around._

_After a few minutes, add the glass of wine and simmer to allow the alcohol to evaporate._

_To the onions and wine, add the vegan stock. I like to add around 500 ml to start with and as the cooking goes on, add some more stock. To the soup add in the marmite, soy, bay leaves and a generous helping of salt and pepper._

_Bring up the heat and the soup starts to bubble, turn down to a low simmer. Place a lid on the pan and check the soup every now and again, giving a stir through. You can add more stock every now and again._

_After around 20 minutes, you should find the onions have softened and the soup is ready to serve._

_Next, heat your grill and toast one side of the bread. Take your clove of garlic and rub into the toasted side. Turn the bread over and sprinkle with grated cheeze and herbs. Place the bread back under the grill until the cheeze has melted._

_Plate up the soup and add on the cheezy crouton. You might want a little extra bed at the side for dunking as you eat the soup._

_Traditionally, you would put the soup into oven proof bowls in the oven. Into each bowl, add your thick slice of bread and top with your grated vegan cheeze. It should take about 5- 7 minutes for the cheeze to start to melt and the bread to toast._

_If you want to thicken the soup, slowly simmering will help and adding some cornflour mixed with cold water._
