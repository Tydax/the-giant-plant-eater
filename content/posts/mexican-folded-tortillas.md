_Tortilla wraps feature in range of Mexican inspired dishes and make a good alternative to the classic sandwich. The wraps can be filled with a variety of different foods. They work well with cold and warm dishes._

_A simple cut and fold of the tortilla gives your layers with different flavours. You can eat the folded tortilla cold or toast it. The contents stay in place and it is easy to eat by hand._

_The below recipe is a take on a classic Mexican style burrito. I toasted it in a heavy flat pan. The cheeze and refried beans were on the outside of the tortilla whilst it was toasted. The salsa and guacamole were in the inner layers._

_You can choose your favourite fillings for this folded tortilla. With the tortilla you need to make one cut from the middle to edge. You place the ingredients in four sections and fold over. I had a little look online and watched some video clips before making them._
