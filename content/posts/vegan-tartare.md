Tartar sauce is the traditional accompaniment mostly associated with fish ‘n’ chips and other seafood dishes. It uses mayonnaise as a base with the adding of pickles, capers, herbs, and lemon juice. Making a vegan alternative is very easy and quick. You can use it to accompany banana blossom fish ‘n’ chips or vegan fish fingers to make a satisfying no-fish finger sandwich. In my blog you will find a recipe for banana blossom fish ‘n’ chips and it easy to buy plant-based fish alternatives. I recently tested out Aldi’s no-fish fingers and enjoyed the texture. The fingers made great sandwiches on thick sourdough bread. The recipe below uses a shop bought vegannaise but you can easily make some vegannaise. Check my blog for a vegannasie recipe.

_Tartare is traditionally used with fish, but it works well with roasted veggies or fries. It will keep in a sealed container in your fridge for about a week._
