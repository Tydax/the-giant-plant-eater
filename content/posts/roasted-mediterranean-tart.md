title: Roasted Mediterranean Tart
author: Graham

---
_This is one of the first dishes I made at the start of Lockdown. I was determined at the time to make sure there was no waste left from the food in the house. There was some ready rolled puff pastry in the fridge that needed to be used up along with some veggies. It became the inspiration for the following dish. It has a base of Ajvar, made from roasted aubergine and red peppers. The tart then has delicate slices of vegetable are placed on top before baking in the oven._

**_Serves 2_**

**_Preparation Time: 10 – 15 mins_**

**_Cooking: 45 minutes_**

**_Ingredients:_**

_Half a roll of puff pastry_

_1 aubergine_

_1 red and ½ yellow bell pepper_

_½ courgette_

_2 tsp of paprika_

_1 tsp of mixed herbs or oregano_

_2 tsp of garlic granules_

_2 tsp of onion granules_

_2- 3 tbsp of oil_

_Plant-based milk for brushing the pastry_

**_Method:_**

_Preheat your oven to 180 degrees c or gas mark 6. Cut half the aubergine and half of the red pepper into large chunks. Mix with 1 – 2 tbsp of oil, 1 tsp each of paprika, garlic and onion granules and season well with salt and pepper before placing into the oven. This will take around 20 – 30 minutes to cook._

_Meanwhile prepare the rest of your veggies by creating thin slices and mixing with the paprika, garlic and onion granules, oregano and oil. Season well and place in the oven. They take about 20 minutes._

_You can then take out the chunks of roasted aubergine and pepper and leave to cool slightly before scooping the flesh and removing the skin. Mash together with a fork and check for seasoning. Your other veggies should be ready for assembling the tart._

_Next, cut out rectangles of pastry and place parchment paper on a baking tray. The size of your pastry should allow strips of the veg to be placed in rows but you can trim them to fit. The mix of aubergine and peppers (Ajvar)is spread on top, leaving a border of pastry. Then you lay the strips of vegetables, creating a pattern of colour._

_Finally brush the edges with a little plant-based milk and put into the middle shelf of the oven for about 15 – 20 minutes._

_The tarts can be served warm with a mixed green salad._

**_Different Toppings_**

_You can add roasted carrots, sweet potatoes or red onion on top of the tart and play about with the seasoning. It would be easy to add some chilli powder, thyme or rosemary to the tart._
