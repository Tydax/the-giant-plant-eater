title: 'Deep Fried Cauliflower '
author: Graham

---
_It is good to indulge yourself every now and again. I generally do not deep fry but on occasions it is a great treat. I like to create no-fish and chips or tempura vegetables. Cauliflower is great for battering and deep frying. It makes a wonderful substitute for classic wings. There are a lot of options for the batter you use. For this dish I used some plant-based milk to make the batter, but you can use sparkling water, beer or just tap water. As an alternative for deep frying, you can bake them in the oven._

**_Serves: 2- 4_**

**_Preparation: 10 minutes_**

**_Cooking: 10 – 15 minutes_**

**_Ingredients:_**

_Cauliflower, cut up into florets_

_125g of pain flour, plus a little for dusting the florets_

_240 ml of plant- based milk, such as soya_

_1 tsp of turmeric_

_1 tsp of garlic powder_

_Salt and pepper to season_

_Vegetable or sunflower oil for frying_

**_Method:_**

_Pre-heat your oven to about 180C or gas mark 6. As your fry the cauliflower in batches, you can pop them in the oven to keep them warm._

_In a bowl whisk the flour, seasoning and plant-based milk together. This will form the batter mixture. If you feel it is too thick or runny, you can easily adjust with some more milk or flour. In another bowl or dish put in some seasoned flour for dusting the cauliflower._

_Meanwhile heat your oil in a deep pan ready for deep frying. You do not want to over-fill the pan with oil and keep a close eye on it as you fry._

_When the oil is hot, use a small piece of cauliflower to test that it is ready. Then take the florets in batches and coat with the seasoned flour before placing in the batter._

_The coated cauliflower is then fried in the oil for around 5 – 7 minutes. When it has crisped up, remove form the pan and remove any excess oil with kitchen paper. The florets can be kept warm in the oven as you continue to cook the cauliflower._

_These tasty bites can be served as wings with a hot sauce or matched with a curry sauce for a katsu curry._

**_Variations_**

_You can add different spices and herbs to the batter from a helping of paprika or curry powder. After frying you could glaze with some hot sauce and maple syrup before baking in the oven for a little while. The cauliflower can be served with a variety of dips from ranch to Siracha mayo._
