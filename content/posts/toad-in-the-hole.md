_This is a great plant-based twist on this traditional British dish and is simple to make. The batter is not as light as classic toad in the hole, but it is just as delicious. You can choose your favourite vegan sausages for this dish and serve it with some onion gravy and green veg. I like a little mash on the side._

**_Method:_**

_Pre-heat your oven to 220C or gas mark 7._

_Prepare your batter mix with the flour, baking powder, salt, and soya milk. Whisk the ingredients together in a metal dish, such as a cake tin, put in the oil and heat in the oven for around 5 minutes. Your tin should not have a loose bottom._

_Carefully take out your tin and place in the sausages. Cook them for about 5- 10 minutes. This allows them to take on some colour._

_Then, taking the hot tin out again, pour in the batter mix before returning to the oven. Bake for about 30 minutes._
