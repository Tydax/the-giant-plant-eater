**Aubergine and Sweet Potato Katsu Curry**

_I first had a version of this dish around 20 years ago in Japanese restaurant, Ichiban, in Glasgow. There is something comforting about that combination of sweet curry sauce and fried veg. It doesn’t feel too far removed from my guilty pleasure food of chips ‘n’ curry sauce. For this dish I have used a Japanese curry mix. The mix is easy to obtain from Asian supermarkets, but you can find equivalents in most supermarkets._

10. _With the veggies in the oven and the curry sauce simmering, prepare your rice according instructions. This should take about 20 minutes._
11. _I like to make a simple Asian inspired salad using grated carrots and shredded lettuce, soy, rice vinegar, sesame seed oil._
12. _When the rice is cooked assemble. I use small bowls of create moulds for the rice. Next to the rice place the veggies and the salad. Gentle pour over the curry sauce and serve._

**_Variations of the Curry_**

_You could easily change the vegetable mix by adding in peppers or tofu. For a quicker curry you can use a prepared breaded meat substitute product such as vegan Quorn nuggets_.
