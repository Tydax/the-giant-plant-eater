title: Lentil Cottage Pie
author: Graham

---
_It is easy to take a classic dish and change it to a plant-based dish. Cottage pie featured regularly in my childhood. My favourite part was the potato topping which was beautifully crisp on top. This version uses green lentils to replace the minced beef. It is wonderfully savoury and comforting. The recipe below uses a little marmite, but you do not need to add it._

**_Method:_**

_Preheat your oven to 220 degrees c or gas mark 7. Then heat the oil in a pan, then add in the onion, carrots, and celery. Cook for a few minutes until softened then add in the lentils. Stir through before adding 300ml of the stock, marmite, soy, and herbs._

_As it bubbles, turn down to a low heat and simmer for 10 – 15 minutes. Add a little more stock from time to time as the mixture cooks._

_Meanwhile prepare your potatoes and boil in salted water for around 15 minutes. When the potatoes are ready, drain them and place them back in the pan with the lid over the heat. Move the pan quickly to allow the water to evaporate before taking off the heat._

_Mash your potatoes then add in the plant-based milk, margarine, and seasoning. Leave the potatoes to cool slightly._

_Check that the lentils are cooked and add seasoning. Place the lentil stew into an oven proof dish or individual dishes such as ramekins. Let the stew cool in the fridge for about 5 minutes._

_The cooling of ingredients will help with the assembling of the cottage pie. The mashed potatoes are best placed in small scoops over the lentil stew. You can use the back of the spoon to smooth the potatoes together. Then using a fork create ridges in the mash. These ridges will help to create a crispy top. Finally brush the top with a little oil before placing the cottage pie into a hot oven._

_Cook them for about 20 minutes before placing under a hot grill to crisp up the potatoes. You can serve the cottage pie with some seasonal greens._

**_Variations of the Cottage Pie._**

_When making the pie you might want to put some grated vegan cheese on top for the last 10 minutes of cooking. You can used tinned green lentils and ready prepared mash to create this dish._
