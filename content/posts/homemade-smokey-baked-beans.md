title: 'Homemade Smokey Baked Beans '
author: Graham

---
_It is always good to enjoy comforting and familiar foods such as baked beans. At the weekend I love baked beans in a brunch, slowly cooked and served with thick sliced toasted sourdough. The tinned variety are great for convenience and have the advantage of a long shelf life. But it is easy to make homemade baked beans using everyday ingredients. In the recipe below, I have used some liquid smoke and maple syrup, but you can substitute them with a little more smoked paprika and brown sugar._

_Preparation: 10 mins_

_Cooking: 10 – 15 mins_

_Serves: 3- 4_

_Simmer the beans on a low heat, allowing the sauce to thicken before adding in the vegan margarine. This will help to create a velvety and rich sauce for the beans._

_Serve the beans on thick slices of toast, as part of a hearty vegan breakfast or in a classic jacket potato._

**_Variations:_**

_If you have time you can soak and prepare dried beans for this dish. The spice level can be changed, and you might want to curry up your beans or add a little barbecue sauce._
