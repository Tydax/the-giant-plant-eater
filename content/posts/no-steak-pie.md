title: 'No-Steak Pie '
author: Graham

---
_It is a great tradition in Scotland on the 1st January after the Hogmanay celebrations to serve a steak pie. The 1st January had been a normal working day and it was important to have an easy meal in the evening. The steak pie would have been bought from the local butcher and form a welcoming dinner after a hard day of work and a late night of celebrations._

_This is a plant-based version, which can be served at any time._

_It uses jackfruit, which is excellent substitute for stewed beef. I have added mushrooms and carrots to the recipe and made individual pies, but you can easily make a larger traditional pie to share. The jackfruit mix will keep for a few days in the fridge and easily freezes._

_At the time of making my oven was playing up and I had to improvise by using part of the grill and the fan to heat the oven. The pie still cooked but the pastry did not rise as much._

_The pie is easy to make and the gravy can be enriched with a little red wine. It is traditionally served with mashed potatoes and you can add some seasonal greens on the side. If you have a slow cooker, you can prepare the stew earlier and let it simmer gently until the evening._

**_Method:_**

_Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees or gas mark 6. Drain and shred your jackfruit._

_Then in a large pan heat 1 tbsp of oil and add in the jackfruit. Cook for a couple of mins before adding the garlic, onion powder and some salt and pepper. Stir and fry the jackfruit for about 5 minutes and remove the jackfruit from the pan._

_![](/content/images/img_20201231_174601.jpg)Add a little more oil and fry off the onion for a few minutes. Then add the carrots, celery, and mushrooms. Stir and fry until the mushrooms start to brown and the onion starts to become translucent._

_Add back in the jackfruit and stir through before adding in the flour. Let the flour cook out slightly before gradually adding in 500ml of stock. The flour will help to thicken the gravy._

_Next add in the soy sauce, bay leaves and plenty of seasoning. Reduce the heat and let the mixture simmer for about 20 – 30 minutes. This will help the jackfruit to break down and the sauce to reduce. You can add a little more stock as required._

_When the no-steak mix is ready you can prepare the pastry. Unroll the pastry and cut to fit your pie dish. You want it to over- hang the dish._

_![](/content/images/img_20201231_185212.jpg)Place your no-steak stew into the pie dish and top with the pastry. Using your thumb and finger to pinch and crimp around the edges. Then with a sharp knife cut out any excess. In the middle of the pie use the knife to cut a small steam vent. You can make individual or a large pie._

_Brush the top of the pie with plant-based milk or some melted margarine._

_Put the pie into the middle shelf and cook for around 20 – 25 minutes. The pastry will have risen and become golden in colour._

_Let your pie sit out for a few minutes before serving with mashed potatoes and seasonal greens._
