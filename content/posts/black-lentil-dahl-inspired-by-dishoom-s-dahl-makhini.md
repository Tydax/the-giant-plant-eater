title: 'Black Lentil Dahl, inspired by Dishoomâ€™s Dahl Makhini '
author: Graham

---
_The joy and layers of flavour in Indian food are great for vegetarians but the addition of ghee, yoghurt and cream into their dishes make them unsuitable for a plant-based diet. Many black dahl recipes add ghee and cream to the final dish. The following recipe is a plant-based version. It takes its inspiration from the Dishoom dish but uses beluga black lentils rather than urad da._

_This is a dish that takes time to prepare and cooks slowly to allow the lentils and to create a rich sauce. You can soak your lentils over-night but washing them before cooking works well. I used Eco Mil cashew cream and Flora plant-based butter for making the dahl. The Dishoom dish uses tomato puree and the next time I make this dish; I will add in the puree._

_Next add some of the stock to cover over the lentils. Bring up the heat until it starts to bubble and then turn down the heat. Place a lid on top and allow the lentils to cook._

_Keep checking the lentils and add more stock over time. Ensure the lentils are stirred through and check they are not sticking to the bottom of the pan._

_Over the next couple of hours, keep repeating the process of adding stock. You may need to prepare more stock to add to the dahl._

_The dish is ready when the sauce has thickened, and the lentils have softened. To the dahl add in the plant-based butter and cashew cream. Check for seasoning and the dish is ready to be served._

**_Serving and Storing the Dahl_**

_The dahl is great served with vegan nan bread or part of selection of Indian dishes. I often make some Bombay potatoes and a classic vegetable curry to accompany the dahl._

_The dahl will keep well in the fridge and for freezing, leave out the butter and cream._
