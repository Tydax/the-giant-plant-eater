_This easy bake has been popular during lockdown and it is a great way to use over ripened bananas. For vegan baking you use oil to replace the eggs and butter. A flavourless oil like sunflower oil is good to use. It takes longer to cook but the results are great. It will keep for a few days in an airtight container and can be frozen._

_Preparation: 10 minutes_

_Baking: 40 mins_

_Makes about 8 slices_

**_Ingredients:_**

_3 large ripe bananas_

_224g of plain flour_

_75ml of vegetable oil_

_100g of brown sugar_

_3tsp of ground cinnamon_

_2 tsp of baking powder_

_Vegan margarine for greasing the tin_

**_Method:_**

_Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees c or gas mark 6. In a large bowl mash your bananas with a fork, then mix in with the oil and sugar._

_Now add your flour, cinnamon and baking powder. Combine the mixture together._

_Set the mixture to the side as you grease a non-stick loaf tin with vegan margarine. You might want to use baking parchment to line the tin._

_Place the mixture in the tin and give the tin a good shake to ensure the mixture has spread evenly._

_Put the tin in the oven for 20 minutes in the middle shelf._

_After 20 minutes, take the tin out and cover the top of the loaf with tin foil. This will stop it burning as you put it back in for another 20 minutes._

_When it is finished baking, remove it from the tin to cool on a baking rack._

_The loaf should be kept in an airtight container._

**_Serving Suggestions_**

_The loaf is good to share at anytime but can be served as a pudding. I enjoy a slice of banana loaf topped with some vegan custard. It is easy to pick up vegan custard in the supermarket. Alpro and Oatly both make dairy free custards. It is also worth checking out the ‘free from’ section in a supermarket. You will often find products that are vegan._
