title: 'TALT (tempeh, avocado, lettuce, tomato with home-made mayo) '
author: Graham

_I enjoy this at a weekend brunch or lunch with a pot of coffee and catch up time with my partner._

_Tempeh is made from fomented soya beans and usually comes in a block or strips. For my dish, I chose smoky flavoured bacon marinated strips. You can marinate unflavoured tempeh or use slices of tofu to create this brunch dish._

_I have used home made vegan mayo ( I have a recipe in my blog) but you can easily use shop bought vegan mayo._

_Assemble your bagel or toasted bread and enjoy._

**_Additions and Changes_**

_It would be easy to leave the avocado out or add in some fried mushrooms. You can add up the heat with some Siracha and put the ingredients on open toasted sandwiches._
