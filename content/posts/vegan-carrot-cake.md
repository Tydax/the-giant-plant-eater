title: 'Vegan Carrot Cake '

_I like to bake for celebrations and often bake this cake at Christmas time. My partner loves this cake, and it is easy to make. I make a butter icing to layer up the cake with and reduce the quantities in half to make a loaf tin carrot cake. It will keep for 3-4 days in a sealed box or tin. You can also freeze the cake without the icing._

**_Decorating the Cake_**

_It is traditional to make a cream cheese topping for a carrot cake and you can buy vegan soft cheese to make the topping and the filling._

_I usually make a butter icing using some vegan margarine and icing sugar. You can flavour it with some cinnamon and ginger. A little lemon or orange zest is good to add. It is easy to experiment with the flavours._

_Spread half of the butter icing on one half of the cake before placing the second half on top. The rest of the icing is then placed on the cake with some walnuts around the edge._

**_Basic Vegan Butter Icing_**

_200g icing sugar_

_1 tsp vanilla essence_

_Method:_

_In a large bowl mix the butter or margarine until it softens. You can use an electric whisk for this._

_Slowly add in the sifted icing sugar to combine._

_At this stage you can add in some flavourings including a little lemon or orange zest. A little plant-based milk can help to make the icing._
