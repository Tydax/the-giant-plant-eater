title: 'Leftover Apple Crumble '
author: Graham

---
_There is so much joy and comfort from stewed apples and other stewed fruit. In the autumn, I would collect brambles whilst out walking to make crumbles and as a child my dad would use the rhubarb from the garden for the dish._

_This recipe does not use cooking apples or brambly apples but instead some left over apples in a fruit bowl. It is a good way to use fruit that is pass its best. These apples are sweeter and require less sugar for stewing._

_I often have royal gala or lady apples in the fruit bowl and used them for the recipe below._

_This is a dish that you can cook alongside your main course. It will happily share the oven space._

**_Variations_**

_You can change the filling easily for your crumble. A good classic is apple and bramble crumble or pear crumble. Rhubarb works well and, in the summer using seasonal berries makes a wonderful pudding._
