title: Salad Leaves with Maple and Mustard Dressing
author: Graham

---
_This salad and dressing are easily made and works as a starter, side or with the addition of some plant-based chicken makes a delicious lunch or dinner._

_I generally use different types of gem lettuce, cos, or romaine lettuce. Unlike bags of mixed leaves, they last longer, and you can take of the amounts of leaves you need to use at the time._

_Most parts of your salad will be stored in the fridge and if you can take them out, so they are served at room temperature. Add your dressing just before serving your salad._

_Below is a suggested mix but you can change it according to your taste or what you have at hand._

**_Make the Salad Bigger_**

_There is an endless list of ingredients to add to a salad. You could add some cooked baby potatoes, blanched green beans, some crumbled vegan feta, walnuts, or apple pieces. Some sliced non-chicken nuggets or strips work well in a salad or some facon made from tofu or mushrooms._

_With cashews, you can create a creamy style Caesar salad and mix in with some romaine lettuce._
