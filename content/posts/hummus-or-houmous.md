title: 'Hummus or Houmous '
author: Graham

_This vegan staple makes a great addition to wraps, burgers, and Mediterranean style mezes. It is a great starter dish or snack served with warm flat breads or crudités. You can easily change the flavour and texture to add spice and warmth._

_This is a quick dish to create with a can of chickpeas, some tahini paste, garlic, lemon, and oil. I prefer to use a flavourless oil. Once made, it will keep in the fridge for a few days._

_When making it recently I had ran out of lemon juice and used lime juice. It worked well._ 

**_Preparation: 5 minutes_**

**_Serves: 3-4_**

_Check for seasoning and flavour. You can add a little more salt and some more lemon juice if needed._

_If you want a smoother hummus you can blend it for longer._

_Place the mixture into a serving dish and scatter the remaining chickpeas on top. You can sprinkle a little paprika over the hummus._
