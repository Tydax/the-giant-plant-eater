_On my travels with my partner, we like search for vegan venues and love stumbling across street food. There is a great variety on offer including burgers, plant-based kebabs, burritos, cauliflower wings and loaded fries. The recipe below is a street food style version of loaded fries with a healthier twist. The chipotle fries are loaded with guacamole, fresh salsa, and coriander mayo. You can easily change the seasoning according to what you have at hand. I have to thank my partner for the recipe._
