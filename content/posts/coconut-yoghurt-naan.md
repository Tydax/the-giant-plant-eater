_Vegetarians are well catered for in curry houses, but it can be trickier for vegans. Their dishes often have ghee (clarified butter), cream or yoghurt added to them. It is easy to recreate dishes and substitute the dairy for plant-based alternatives._

_This naan recipe used coconut-based yoghurt and needs a little prep time. However, the breads can be made in batches and freeze easily._

**_Preparation: 20 minutes_**
