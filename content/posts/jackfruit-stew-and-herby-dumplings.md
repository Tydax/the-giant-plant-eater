title: 'Jackfruit Stew and Herby Dumplings '
author: Graham

---
_This dish can be enjoyed all year round and can be easily adapted to season. As a child, I loved a classic stew and dumplings. My mum would sometimes put raisins inside her mix. Traditionally dumplings would involve suet, but I have used a veggie suet replacement. You can make dumplings with margarine instead of the suet replacement._

_Whilst the dish is cooking in the oven, you can start preparing the dumplings._

_Place the dry ingredients into a bowl and combine slowly with the water to make a sticky dough. You may need a little flour to help form the dough into about 8 balls._

_Take the stew out from the oven and place the dough balls gently in._

**_Changing the Dish_**

_The dish allows for a variety of flavours. You might add a glass of red wine at the beginning of cooking or a small spoon of marmite._

_To make it more like a goulash, remove the soy sauce and add in paprika and some fresh tomatoes. You can add in some peppers before placing the dough balls on top._
