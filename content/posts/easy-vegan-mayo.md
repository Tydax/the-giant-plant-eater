title: Easy Vegan Mayo
author: Graham

---
_This is an easy recipe to follow to make vegan mayo at home. It keeps for up to 5 days in a container in the fridge and you can adjust the quantity as needed. It is easy now to buy ready made vegan mayo from most supermarkets._

_I find a flavourless oil such as sunflower oil great to making the mayo and soya milk works the best. However, you can use almond milk to give an acceptable mayo._

_Ideally, you should let the ingredients get to room temperature before making._

_Using a stick blender combine the mixture for about 30 seconds. You will see the mixture coming together._

**_A Little Variety_**

_It is easy to change the flavour by adding a clove of garlic or spicing it up with some curry powder or adding a little Siracha._
