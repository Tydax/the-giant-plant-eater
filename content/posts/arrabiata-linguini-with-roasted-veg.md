title: Arrabiata Linguini with Roasted Veg
author: Graham

---
_It is easy to pull together a quick tomato-based pasta sauce and it lends itself to the addition of different ingredients. For this dish I have roasted some vegetables to add to the sauce. They add sweetness to the sauce and bring a depth of flavour. The sauce will keep for a few days in the fridge and would easily freeze. You can use different types of pasta here and I am often influenced by what is in the store cupboard._

**_Changing the Sauce_**

_The heat of the sauce can be adjusted by the amount of chilli you add. You could add in some fresh herbs or some red wine to add a different flavour to the sauce._
