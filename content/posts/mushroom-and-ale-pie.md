title: Mushroom and Ale Pie
author: Graham

---
_This is a satisfying alternative to a pub grub classic. It is a comforting dish to share and is easy to make. You can choose a favourite vegan ale or stout like Guinness to help create the sauce for the filling. I enjoy serving it with some seasonal veggies and a little mash. The filling will freeze easily, and you can also freeze the complete pie and cook from frozen._

**_Preparation: 25 minutes_**

**_Cooking: 30 â€“ 35 minutes_**

**_Serves: 3- 4_**

**_Ingredients:_**

_400g of chestnut mushrooms_

_200ml of dark ale_

_100ml of vegan stock_

_2-3 tbsp of vegetable oil_

_1 tbsp of soy_

_1 tsp of marmite (optional)_

_2 onions, finely chopped_

_2 gloves of garlic, minced_

_1 sheet of vegan puff pastry_

_2 bay leaves_

_Salt and pepper to season_

_1 tbsp of plain flour_

_Plant-based milk or melted margarine for glazing the pie_

**_Method:_**

_Heat the oven to 180 degrees and prepare the mushrooms by slicing. Mix the mushrooms with 1 tbsp of oil and some seasoning before placing on a baking tray lined with baking parchment._

_Place the mushrooms into the oven and heat the rest of the oil in a large pan. Add in the onions and once they begin to soften add in the garlic. Fry the onions and garlic until they soften._

_To the onions stir in the flour and cook for a minute before adding in the ale, stock, soy, and bay leaves. Let the mixture cook for a while and reduce. You can add in a little marmite to mixture._

_Take the mushrooms from the oven and add with to the stock and ale. Add any juices from the baking tray and remove from the bay leaves._

_Check the mixture for seasoning before preparing the pastry. Place the mixture into 1 large or individual pie dishes. Lay the pastry on top and use a knife to cut off any excess. Using your thumb and finger crimp the edges before brushing the top with melted margarine or plant-based milk._

_Use a knife to cut some cut a cross in the middle before placing in the middle shelf of the oven. The pie should take around 30 minutes to cook._

_The pie is great served with some seasonal veggies. Below I made some cheezy cauliflower and braised red cabbage._
