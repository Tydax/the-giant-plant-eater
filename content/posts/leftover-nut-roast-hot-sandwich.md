title: 'Leftover Nut Roast Hot Sandwich '
author: Graham

---
_My vision of sandwiches has been transformed by an establishment in Edinburgh called Abli’s. It is tucked away in Leith and is a gem of a gourmet cafe. They do amazing sandwiches made with focaccia bread and always have an imaginative plant-based option. They have influenced this sandwich which uses leftover nut roast. The contents of the fridge can be a great inspiration and it would be easy to adapt this big sandwich._

_A few sliced picked would be a good addition to this sandwich to add a little sharpness._

**_Preparation: 5- 10 minutes_**

**_Cooking: 5 – 10 minutes_**

**_Serves: 2_**

**_Ingredients:_**

_4 slices of thick brown sourdough bread (or another bread of your choice)_

_2- 4 slices of nut roast, depending on the size_

_A generous handful of brussels sprouts, cooked or fresh and sliced_

_A generous handful of baby plum or cherry tomatoes_

_6 tbsp of leftover gravy, warmed_

_Vegan mayonnaise_

_1 tsp of oil_

_I clove of garlic_

_Salt and pepper to season_

**_Method:_**

_Heat the oil in the pan and cook the slices of nut roast and sprouts._

_After a few minutes add a crushed clove of garlic to the sprouts, then add the tomatoes with plenty of salt and pepper._

_Turn over the nut roast, so it cooks and browns on both sides. The sprouts will start to char around the edges and the tomatoes will soften._

_Meanwhile toast the sourdough lightly and your sandwich is ready to be layered up._

_On the bottom half put the warm gravy then a few of the sprouts and tomatoes. Place the slices of roast before adding more tomatoes and sprouts._

_On the top layer, smother with vegan mayo before sandwiching your layers together. Cut in half and your sandwich is ready to be served._

_I swapped the sprouts for some cabbage for the next creation._
