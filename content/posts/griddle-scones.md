_My mum would often make these scones, and we would enjoy them for breakfast fresh from the griddle. I have adapted the recipe for a plan- based diet. It is an easy adapt using vegan margarine and plant-based milk. I often use Flora buttery for baking but there are plenty of margarines out there to choose from._

**_Method:_**

_In a large bowl put in the flour, bicarbonate of soda and cream of tartar. To this add the margarine in small chunks and rub into the mixture with your fingertips. Keep rubbing until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs._

_Next stir in the sugar and gradually add the plant-based milk until you end up with a soft dough. You may not need to add in all the milk. I sometimes add a little flour to help work the dough into a ball._

_Heat a heavy based frying pan and lightly grease with some margarine. A non-stick pan is the best to use and I am fortunate to have inherited my mumâ€™s griddle pan. Rub the pan with the margarine on a paper towel._

_Take your dough and divide into two parts. Knead lightly and roll out each piece on a floured surface. You should end up with a circle of dough about 1cm thick. Cut each rolled-out dough into 6 wedges._

_![](/content/images/img_20200729_100508.jpg)Cook the wedges in batches in the hot pan. They need around 5 minutes for each side until they become brown on each side._

_They are best eaten on the day you make them but will keep for a couple of days in an airtight container. You can warm them in the oven before serving them._

_The scones are easily frozen._

**_Variation of the Recipe_**

_You can make these scones using self-raising flour and 2 tsp of baking powder instead of bicarbonate and cream of tartar._
