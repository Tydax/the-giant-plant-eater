title: No-Fish and Chips with Vegan Tartar
author: Graham

---
_Banana blossoms form the base of this wonderful dish served with a home-made vegan tartar sauce. You can buy tinned banana blossoms from Asian supermarkets and they are easily transformed into battered no-fish. In this recipe, I have used a vegan beer to make the batter, but you could easily use sparkling water instead. The blossoms do not take long to cook in the hot batter. I start off by preparing the vegan tartar, then the oven baked chips before tackling the no-fish._

_Prepare your flour and batter mixture. You can adjust the thickness of your batter if necessary. Then drain and rinse your banana blossoms._

_In a deep wide pan heat your oil. The oil needs to be hot for deep frying and you can test with a small piece of banana blossom first. Keep an eye on your pan as you fry._
