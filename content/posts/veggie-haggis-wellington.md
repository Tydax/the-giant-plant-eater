title: Veggie Haggis Wellington
author: Graham

---
_This dish is great for a special occasion or as an alternative Sunday roast. It requires just a few ingredients and a little time to prepare. The two main ingredients are ready rolled puff pastry and veggie haggis. These shop bought items combined with mushrooms, spinach and some seasoning make a wonderful Wellington. It is relatively easy to pick up chilled veggie haggis and most shop bought pastry is plant-based._

_Serves 4 - 6_

_Preparation: 20 minutes_

_Cooking: 30 – 40 minutes_

**_Ingredients:_**

_Chilled veggie haggis (around 450g)_

_Ready rolled puff pastry_

_250g of chestnut mushrooms, sliced_

_100g of baby spinach_

_1 tbsp of oil_

_I tbsp of margarine or vegan butter_

_2 cloves of garlic, minced_

_Salt and pepper to season_

_Plant- based milk for brushing the pastry_

**_Method:_**

_Pre-heat your oven to 190 degrees c or gas mark 5. Then gently break up your veggie haggis into a microwaveable container. Heat the haggis for 3 minutes on a high power and leave to the side. This will help to mould the haggis for the Wellington. if you don't have a microwave, you can still form the haggis for the dish without cooking it first._ 

_Meanwhile in a heavy based frying pan, heat the oil and add in the mushrooms and garlic. Fry the mushrooms for a few minutes, then add the margarine. Cook for a few more minutes, then add in the spinach. When the spinach has wilted and the mushrooms are cooked, turn off the heat and leave to cool. Season the mixture well with salt and pepper._

_Next, take the pastry and lay on a flat surface. It is important that everything has cooled before making the Wellington. First, place some of the cooled mushroom and spinach mixture on the pastry in the middle. Then take the haggis and form into a into a domed shape. This sits on the mushroom and spinach mixture. The rest of the mixture is then placed over the haggis._

_The pastry is now wrapped over the haggis, spinach and mushroom mix. You are creating a sealed parcel of pastry with the plant-based milk helping to seal the edges. Use your thumb and finger, pinch the edges ._

_Place the Wellington carefully onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper. You might find a fish slice helped to lift it. Brush the outside of the pastry and place in the middle shelf of the oven._

_It will take around 30 – 40 mins to cook. When ready, take out and let rest for 5 – 10 mins before serving. You can cut your Wellington into slices._

**_Serving Ideas_**

_I like to serve the Wellington whole and cut it as I serve it at the table. It benefits from having an onion, veggie or mushroom gravy. I like to serve some roasted potatoes and green veg at the side. If you have some left over, it works well re-heated in the oven and then served with some different chutneys._
