title: Jackfruit Goulash

_This is a quick and easy plant-based version of the classic Hungarian dish. It uses paprika to deliver warmth and the jackfruit makes a great meat substitute. It goes well with rice, thick ribboned pasta, or potatoes. You can add some soured plant-based yogurt on top of the dish and have some crusty bread to mop up the left-over stew in the plate._
