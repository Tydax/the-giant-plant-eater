title: 'Vegan Currywurst '

This German fast-food staple sold at Imbiss stands often on street corners. The traditional wurst or sausage is a bratwurst which is sliced and topped with a curried ketchup then sprinkled with curry powder. It is often served with bread or fries. The origins of Currywurst are believed to come from after the Second World War in Berlin. Here, ketchup or maybe Worcestershire sauce and curry powder from British soldiers was obtained by Herta Heuwer. She then used the ingredients to make the sauce for the bratwurst.

Below is a recipe for Currywurst using ketchup and vegan hotdogs. You can buy vegan style wurst sausages and I am always on the hunt for new vegan products. You can easily make your own tomato sauce for the wurst. I made spiced wedges to go with the dish and served them with some bread rolls.

**Serves 2**

**Time to prepare sauce: 5 – 10 minutes**

**Preparing plant-based wurst: 8 – 12 minutes**

**Wedges or Fries: 20 – 30 minutes**

In a small pan, heat the ketchup gently before adding in the dried ingredients.

Stir through before adding in the wet ingredients. You can add more water if needed.

Heat on a low heat for 5- 10 minutes and your sauce is ready to serve. Check for seasoning and if needed you can all a little more spice to the sauce.

**Variations and Storage**

You can make your own tomato sauce for the currywurst or play about with the spices. The sauce will keep for a while in the fridge in a sealed container.
