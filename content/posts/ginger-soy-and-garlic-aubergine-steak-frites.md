title: Ginger, Soy and Garlic Aubergine Steak Frites
author: Graham

---
_Aubergine has a wonderful texture which works well when marinating and roasting. In this dish, it takes centre stage in a twist on the classic ‘steak frites’. If you have time, let the aubergine marinated over-night or you can leave it for a few hours. I have changed the classic shoestring fries for garlic wedges and used the left-over marinade to dress the salad._
