> **Chilli Can Can or Tin Tin Chilli**

Store cupboard ingredients can make a great meal and I find this simply chilli a comforting mid-week dish. The left-over chilli forms a great base for vegan nachos or added to a classic baked potato. For the base of the base a can of green lentils takes centre stage. It adds bite and texture to the dish. I also find dried green lentils are quick to cook in his dish.

**Adding to the Dish**

You can change or add to the types of beans for this chilli with black beans or pinto beans. A handful of corn chips, or some plant based plain yoghurt that you sour with lemon juice are good additions. A sprinkling of fresh coriander will enhance the dish.
