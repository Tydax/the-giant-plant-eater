title: 'Egg-Less Mayo Sandwiches '

_Tofu makes a great alternative to chopped eggs in this simple and satisfying sandwich. It is easy to prepare and requires no cooking._

_When making this, I used some chop coriander that I had in the fridge but in a classic version you would use cress. A little nutritional yeast would be a good addition to the sauce for this sandwich._

**_Serves: 2- 4_**

**_Preparation: 10 â€“ 15 minutes_**
