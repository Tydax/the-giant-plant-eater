_This is super easy and quick to make. It is great for a brunch dish or adding to a stir-fried rice dish. You need a few ingredients and frying pan and you can quickly pull things together._

_Serves: 1-2_ 

_Preparation: 5 mins_

_Cooking: 5- 10 minutes_

**_Ingredients:_**

_150g of pressed tofu_

_1 onion, chopped finely_

_1 tbsp of vegetable oil_

_½ tsp of turmeric_

_½ tsp of garlic powder_

_½ tsp of onion powder_

_Salt and pepper to season_

**_Method:_**

_Place your tofu between 2 plates and put some weights on top. I often use a tin from the cupboard. This will help to remove excess water._

_Meanwhile heat some oil in a frying pan and gentle fry the onion. When the onion is softened add in the spices and crumbled the block of tofu by hand into the pan._

_Stir together and fry for a few minutes before adding salt and pepper._

_It is now ready to serve and to give it a little kick you can add some Sriracha on top. I enjoy it at the weekend for brunch._

**_Changing the Scramble_**

_It is easy to change the heat or taste by adding in some smoked paprika or some chilli powder to the scramble. I also use the scramble for adding to stir-fried rice._
