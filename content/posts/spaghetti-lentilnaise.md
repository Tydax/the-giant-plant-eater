title: 'Spaghetti Lentilnaise '
author: Graham

---
_In my first flat share as a student, I made a version of spaghetti bolognaise for my flat mates. I was very nervous cooking for others and relied on a ready-made sauce and dried parmesan to sprinkle on top. The meal was eaten, and I was glad the event was over. It took me a few years to move on from jars of sauces to making a flavourful tomato sauce. The recipe below uses green lentils with an easy tomato sauce. The dish is often best served the next day. This allows the lentils to absorb more into the sauce. You can use tinned green lentils to speed up the cooking._

**_Serves: 3- 4_**

**_Preparation: 10 minutes_**

**_Cooking: 40 - 50 minutes_**

**_Ingredients:_**

_100g of dried green lentils or 1 tin of green lentils_

_2 banana shallots or 1 large onion, chopped_

_3 cloves of garlic, minced_

_1 stick of celery, chopped finely_

_1 carrot, chopped finely_

_1 can of chopped tomatoes or carton of passata_

_300ml of vegan stock_

_80g of mushrooms, sliced_

_1 tbsp of tomato puree_

_2 tbsp of vegetable oil_

_I knob of vegan margarine or butter substitute_

_2 tsp of dried herbs_

_Salt and pepper to season_

**_Method:_**

_Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a large pan. Add in the shallots and fry gently before adding in the 2 cloves of minced garlic, carrots, and celery. Cook for around 5- 10 minutes, allowing the shallots to start to brown and the vegetables begin to soften._

_Next add in the dried lentils and stir through before adding the tomatoes, stock, herbs, and seasoning. Bring up the heat and as the mixture bubbles, turn down to a slow simmer. Place on a lid and let the mixture cook for around 40 â€“ 50 minutes. If you used tinned lentils, then reduce this time to around 15 minutes._

_Whilst the lentils are cooking, in a separate pan heat the remaining oil and fry the sliced mushrooms. After a few minutes add in one crushed glove of garlic and plenty of seasoning. Cook until the mushrooms start to brown. You can add the mushrooms to the lentil mix around 30 mins into the cooking time._

_Next bring a large pan of water to the boil. Add in some salt and a splash of oil. Place the spaghetti into the pan and cook on high for around 9 minutes. Allow around 75g of uncooked pasta per person._

_Check the lentilnaise for seasoning and add the butter to stir to help create a velvet sauce. Drain the pasta and add the lentilnaise to the cooked pasta. Stir through and serve in large bowls._

**_A Little Extra_**

_You can add some vegan parm to the dish at the end or a glass of red wine at the start of cooking. The green lentils can be substituted for red. They need less cooking time as they soften and absorb the liquid quicker._

_On the side, you can serve a little salad or some seasonal sauteed veg._
