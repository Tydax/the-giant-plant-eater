_I have made these rolls for a journey to France by train. I often make them for a party or wee gathering. They are great warm from the oven or cold next day. They will last a few days in a sealed container without being refrigerated or you can easily freeze them._

_I use ready rolled puff pastry from the supermarket. It just happens to be vegan and perfect for several uses._

_Below is a recipe that uses 2 different types of fillings. I often make the filling with my cashew and lentil nut roast mix or when I am in a hurry with some veggie haggis._

_Makes around 16 rolls_

_Preparation (using a prepared filling): 10 minutes_

_Cooking: 15 â€“ 20 minutes_

**_Ingredients:_**

_Ready rolled puff pastry_

_Veggie haggis or cashew and lentil nut roast mix_

_Plant based milk for brushing the pastry_

**_Method:_**

_Pre-heat oven to 180 degrees c or gas mark 6_

_Break up the veggie haggis and microwave on high for about 3 minutes or have your nut roast mix ready. Your filling should not be too warm for forming the rolls._

_Lay out your pastry on a board and put a strip of filling along the length of the pastry. You are going to fold over the pastry to form the rolls._

_Brush the pastry with the plant-based milk to help it seal as you fold it over. With you thumb press down the pastry to make the rolls._

_With a knife cut along the length of the pastry and divide the long roll into bite size rolls._

_Place the rolls on baking tray lined with baking parchment. Repeat the process until all the pastry is used._

_Prick the rolls with a fork and brush with plant-based milk before putting into the oven to cook._

_Check on your rolls and adjust the time until they are golden brown. When they are ready, place the rolls on a cooling rack._

_The rolls can be eaten warm or cold. I enjoy them with brown sauce but you may be a red sauce fan._
