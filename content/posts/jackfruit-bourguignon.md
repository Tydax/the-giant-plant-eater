_I grew up in a household where comforting stews and casseroles were often served. I still love these dishes and now create them with a plant-based twist.  Jackfruit is a great ingredient to take on flavours and provide texture in slow cooked stews. The following recipe is a take on a French classic. Bonne appetite!_

**_Plating up the dish_**

_This is a good dish to share with the pot on the table for people to dig in. It works well with mashed potatoes or pasta. I made this dish during lockdown and used up some new potatoes to accompany the warming stew._

_I feel this dish could easily become a goulash or a classic stew with dumplings. I plan to explore and make some more._
