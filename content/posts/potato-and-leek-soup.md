author: Graham

---
_In Scotland, we would call this tattie and leek soup. This warming soup is great to warm you up and needs just a little preparation. A generous helping of freshly ground pepper enhances the flavour. This recipe is for a chunky soup, but you can easily blend the soup and add a little plant-based milk at the end._

**_Preparation: 10 minutes_**

**_Cooking: 20 â€“ 30 mins_**

**_Serves: 4_**
