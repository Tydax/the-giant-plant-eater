title: No Tuna 'n' Sweetcorn
author: Graham

---
_A can of chickpeas is transformed into this vegan alternative. It is quick and simple to make and keeps in the fridge for a few days. I use the mix for week-day lunches in hearty bread. You do not need to add the sweetcorn, but a little chopped red onion will add crunch to this dish. I have also made it without capers._
