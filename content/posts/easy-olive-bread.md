_I have found this recipe handy for making a quick loaf during lockdown. I would make it in the morning as I go about other tasks. I have been lucky to get hold of some fresh yeast from my local Portuguese baker and had some quick acting yeast in the cupboard._ 

_Preparation: 10 – 15 minutes_

_Proving: 45 minutes_

_Baking: 30 – 35 minutes_

**_Ingredients:_**

_500g of bread flour_

_300 ml of lukewarm water (100 ml of hot water plus 200 ml of cold water)_

_2 tbsps. of olive oil_

_2 tsps. of salt_

_1 tsp of sugar_

_1 tsp (7g) of quick acting yeast or 15g of fresh yeast_

**_Method:_**

_Measure out the flour into a large mixing bowl and add in all the dry ingredients. I add the yeast last and try to avoid it mixing with the salt._

_When all mixed in, tip the dough onto a floured surface. Kneed the dough for about 5 minutes. You should have a nice smooth ball of dough._

_Place the dough on a baking tray which is lined with baking parchment. I like to flour the surface before putting the dough on top._

_Score the dough and lightly flour it before placing a damp tea towel over. Leave the dough for around 45 minutes to rise._

_Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees c of gas mark 6. The risen dough is put into the middle shelf for around 30 – 35 minutes._

_You can check your bread after 30 minutes and leave it if for a little longer if required._

_When the bread is ready, take out and place on a wire rack to cool._
