title: 'Tofu Fried Rice with Veggies '
author: Graham

---
_This is a good end of the week dish where you can check what you have in your store cupboards and fridge. I variate this dish according to what I happen to have. This recipe uses scrambled tofu and you can find the recipe here in my blog. I have used a ready prepared hoisin sauce but you could change that for some soy sauce and fresh ginger._

_Serves: 2_

_Preparation: 5 minutes_

_Cooking: 15 minutes_

_150g of basmati rice_

_Scrambled tofu (see blog recipe)_

_2- 3 tbsp of vegetable oil_

_2 – 3 tbsp of hoisin sauce_

_1 green pepper sliced_

**_Method:_**

_Prepare your rice by rinsing first and then placing in a pan with 150 ml of boiling water with the turmeric and a generous amount of salt. Bring the rice to the boil then turn down to a very low heat with the lid on. Check the rice after 10 minutes. You might need to cook for a little bit longer. At the end use a fork to fluff the rice. I have the advantage of having a rice cooker._

_Whilst the rice is cooking prepare your scrambled tofu and set to the side once ready._

_In the same pan add 2 tbsp of oil and on a high heat start frying the veg apart from the peas with the garlic powder. Season the veg with some salt and pepper. You may find you need to add more oil to fry the veg. When the veg is nearly ready add in your peas and cook for a couple of minutes._

_Next add in the hoisin sauce and once everything is coated add in the rice and scrambled tofu. Mix through and check for seasoning. You can add a tbsp of hoisin sauce to the rice mix if you wish._

_Serve the dish in bowls and if you have some garnish with chopped spring onions._

**_A Changing Dish_**

_I love to stir fry with broccoli and cauliflower, and it is easy to use ingredients form the fridge, cupboards or freezer to change about this dish. It can be spiced in different ways and you can add some heat with chillies or a hot sauce. You might want to remove some ingredients and create stir-fried rice to accompany a main dish._
