_Tandoori traditionally involves marinating and cooking in a clay oven (tandoor) with intense heat. Yogurt and spices are used to create the marinade for this popular dish._

_It is easy to replace the meat in the tandoori with tofu or vegetables. I have 2 versions to share. They both use the same marinade. Ideally you should leave your dish overnight to marinade in the fridge but if you are in a hurry around 30/40 minutes will do._
