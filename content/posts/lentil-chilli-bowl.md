title: Lentil Chilli Bowl
author: Graham

---
_Green lentil chilli is full of flavour and texture. The lentils keep a little of their bite in this classic plant-based dish. You can use tinned or dried lentils to make the dish. In a chilli bowl you add rice, guacamole, salsa, tortilla chips and cheeze. The addition of a little cocoa powder will add depth to your chilli. A little plant-based soured yoghurt would be a good addition._

_Check out my other chilli recipe on the blog. It uses tinned lentils in the mix_

**_Preparation: 5 – 10 minutes_**

**_Ingredients for the chilli:_**

_175g of green lentils_

_1 large onion, peeled and chopped_

_2 cloves of garlic, crushed_

_1 can of chopped tomatoes_

_1 can of kidney beans_

_1 can of mixed beans or black beans_

_400 ml of vegetable stock, you may need more as you cook_

_I tbsp of tomato puree_

_2 tbsp of vegetable oil_

_2 tsp of chilli powder, you can more of less, depending on the heat you want._

_1 tsp of cumin powder_

_1 tsp of cocoa powder_

_Handful of chopped coriander_

_Salt and pepper to season._

**_Method:_**

_Rinse your lentils and head the oil in a large pan._

_Add in the onions and allow them to soften before adding in the crushed garlic._

_Next stir through the lentils before adding the chopped tomatoes, stock, puree, cocoa powder, and spices._

_Bring up the heat until the mixture is bubbling and then turn down the heat._

_Cook for around 40 – 50 minutes to allow the lentils to soften and the chilli to reduce. As it cooks, stir it occasionally and add more water if needed._

_Check for seasoning and add a little chopped coriander, keeping a little coriander at the side for sprinkling on top at the end._

**_Creating the chilli bowl_**

_In my blog you will find how to make guacamole and tomato salsa in my nacho recipe. 2 medium avocados would work for 4 people. I cook around 60 – 90g of dried rice per person._

_For serving, use a large bowl for each person. Place in a portion of rice, chilli, guacamole, salsa, and tortilla chips into the bowl. Sprinkle over some grated cheeze over the chilli and garnish with chopped coriander. You can also add a little soured plant-based yoghurt._

**_Alternatives and Suggestions_**

_You might want to use a plant-based mince to make your chilli or use Mediterranean vegetables. Your chilli will freeze well and can be used for nachos or as a filling for a baked potato._
