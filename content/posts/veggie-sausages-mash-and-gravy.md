_When you need comfort, a familiar dish can help. A classic veggie sausage, mash and gravy is perfect comfort food. It is an easy dish to prepare and is delicious served with some seasonal greens. You can choose your favourite plant-based sausage for this recipe or if you have time have a go at making some veggie sausages. These do not have to be complicated and use ingredients you have in the house. Using pulses, nuts, carrots and breadcrumbs it is easy to make a sausage mix._

_For sides, I like some seasonal greens or a generous helping of frozen peas. If you are in a hurry, you will find vegan friendly ready prepared mash which can be heated in the microwave._

_Meanwhile in another pan, add in the oil and place on a medium add. When the oil is hot, add in the onions and after a few minutes add in the garlic and a little seasoning. Cook the onions on a medium heat to allow them to start to become translucent. You add a little soft brown sugar when cooking the onions to help them caramelise and add sweetness to the gravy._ 

_Slowly add your stock to the onions and the soy sauce. Allow the gravy to simmer and reduce slightly._

_Cook your sausages according to the instructions and prepare some veggies to go on the side._

_Drain your potatoes and return them to the pan over the heat. Move the pan briskly over the heat to remove any excess water. Mash your potatoes in the pan and add in some plant-based milk and vegan butter. Check your mash for seasoning. If you want, you can add a little grated nutmeg or some grainy mustard._

**_Choosing a Mash_**

_There are different possibilities for the mash you serve with this dish. A root veg mash would be great with the addition of some carrot and swede. You can flavour your mash with some spring onions, grated vegan cheese or fried onions. Sweet potatoes make an excellent mash, and you might want to add in a little heat with some chilli and paprika._

_There is an increasing choice out there of veggie or no-meat sausages to choose from. They are often found chilled, but you can buy them frozen. You can tailor them according to your preference, it is easy if you want to cut out soy or need something that is gluten free. The major supermarkets have their plant-based products and produce some good meatless sausages._
