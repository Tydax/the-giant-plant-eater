**Roasted Vegetable Biryani with Chickpea and Spinach Curry**

_My first part time job was as a kitchen porter in an Indian restaurant and this was a favourite curry of mine when working there. Biryani is a fantastic sharing dish and you can easily adjust the quantity to make a smaller amount. The rice dish requires a little time to prepare and cook but it is worth the wait. It gives gentle warmth from the spices which contrast the sharpness from the lemon juice._

_Serves 4- 6_

_Prep: 20 -30 mins_

_Cooking: 1 hr_

_3 – 4 carrots, chopped into good sized slices_

_½ tsp of garlic powder_

_1.Preheat your oven to 220 degrees / gas mark 7 and prepare your vegetables._

_2.Place the chopped vegetables, apart from the green beans into a large rectangular dish with the oil, cumin powder, garlic powder. Stir the vegetable with the oil and spices then season well. Roast the vegetables in the oven for about 20 minutes._

_3.Meanwhile prepare your stock, add in the curry powder, turmeric and mustard seeds._

_4.Whilst the veg are roasting in the oven I usually make a quick side curry to put on top of the biriyani. The dish if often served with raita. This can be made easily with coconut based or soya-based yoghurt._

_5. Take the veggies out from the oven. Mix in the rice, green beans and add in the stock. Cover the dish with tin foil and place back in the oven. Turn down the heat to 180 degrees and leave for 30 minutes._

_6. After 30 minutes, check your dish that the rice is cooked. It may need another 10 – 15 minutes._

_7. When the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is cooked take the dish out of the oven. Check for seasoning before squeezing in the juice of 1 lemon. Add a handful of chopped cashews, a generous amount of chopped coriander and some lemon wedges on top._

_I like to serve this as a sharing dish and when I have time with some freshly made vegan nan._

**_Making a Change_**

_The basics of the biriyani involve adding a measured amount of stock for the rice to absorb. The tin foil lid helps the absorbing off the liquid. However, it is a dish with many possibilities to the spices you add and the veg you put in. You might consider sweet potatoes or adding in peas near the end of the cooking time._

**_A Quick Curry of Spinach and Chick Peas_**

_To compliment the biriyani, I make a quick chick pea and spinach curry. It can simmer slowly whilst the rice is cooking in the oven._

_Cooking time: 20 – 30 minutes_

_Preparation: 10 minutes_

_Ingredients:_

_I can of chick peas_

_I can of chopped tomatoes_

_300 ml of vegan stock_

_Small bag of spinach – 100 g_

_I chopped onion_

_2 crushed cloves of garlic_

_1 tsp of oil_

_¼ tsp of chilli powder_

_½ ground coriander_

_½ ground ginger_

_½ turmeric_

_2 tsp of curry powder_

_Method:_

_1.Gently fry the chopped onion, add in the garlic and spices, Stir for a few minutes._

_2. Add in the chopped tomatoes and drained chickpeas and vegan stock_

_3. Heat through the dish and bring down the temperature. At this time stir in your spinach._

_4. Place a lid on the pot and let it gentle simmer for around 20 – 30 minutes_

_5. Check for seasoning and you can always add a little more spice if desired with some curry or chilli powder._

_This dish works well on the second day as the spinach has time to break down more into the curry. You can swap fresh spinach for frozen spinach. If you feel your dish is too spicy then add some coconut milk or plant based yoghurt._
