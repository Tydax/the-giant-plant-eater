_I remember as a child my mum often baking in the afternoon. The kitchen was her domain, and she would often made griddle scones and dropped scones. The dropped scone is a Scottish pancake, made traditionally on a round griddle pan._

_The secret of cooking the dropped scone or pancake is to get the pan to the right temperature and coat it with a little butter, wiped on with a paper towel. Then to make a test pancake with a little of the batter._

_For this version of pancakes, I have used bananas. It is a simple and quick recipe to follow and makes delicious fluffy pancakes._

_You can use all the batter or keep some in the fridge for making pancakes the next day._

**_Makes: 4- 6 large pancakes or 10 – 12 small pancakes_**

**_Preparation: 5 minutes_**

**_Cooking: 2- 3 minutes per batch of pancakes_**

_Lightly grease your pan or griddle and make a test pancake. Look for bubbles forming all over before turning. They will need around 1 to 2 minutes on each side._

_For small pancakes, a generous spoonful of mixture is good or for large pancakes a small ladle of mixture._

_The large pancakes can be kept warm and served with maple syrup and chopped bananas._

**_Serving and Variations_**

_The pancakes are best eaten on the day or the day after. You can keep them in a sealed container, and they would freeze easily._

_You can adapt the recipe and maybe add in some blueberries or change over the golden syrup for maple syrup._

_There is a huge choice of topping out there from jam, syrup, bananas, berries or Biscoff._
