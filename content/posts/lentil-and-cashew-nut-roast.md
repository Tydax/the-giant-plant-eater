**_Lentil and Cashew Nut Roast_**

_I once had a meatless roast in a Brewer’s Fayre, attached to a Premier Inn. I was excited about a filled Yorkshire pudding with veggies and gravy. However, when it arrived, it was missing the roast. I enquired and found out the veggie version was achieved by not adding the meat. To be fair, the trimmings are part of the experience and sometimes the best bit._

_This nut roast would have been a good addition to the trimmings. It is an excellent Sunday supplement for the roast of the day and works well for a celebration dinner. I would be happy with this on my plate on Christmas day._

**_Ingredients:_**

_300ml of vegan stock_

_90 g of red lentils_

_80 g of unsalted cashew nuts, chopped into small pieces_

_50 g of wholemeal bread crumbs_

_2 medium carrots, grated_

_2 chopped onions_

_I small celery stick, chopped_

_2 cloves of garlic, crushed_

_2 tbsps of oil_

_½ tsp of paprika_

_½ tsp of onion powder_

_½ tsp of nutmeg_

_¼ tsp of chilli powder_

_Salt and pepper to season_

**_Method_**

_1. Pre-heat the oven on to 100 degrees c or gas mark 1._

_2. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a pan, add chopped onion and 1 garlic glove. Gently fry until the onions are softened._

_3. Add in the lentils, stock, paprika, chilli and bring up the heat. When it starts to bubble, turn to a low heat and simmer for about 15 minutes. The lentils should have absorbed most of the liquid but still have texture. When ready, check for seasoning._

_4. Place the cashew nuts in the oven on a baking tray. They need between 7 – 10 minutes to toast in the oven and it is worth keeping your eye on them._

_5. Meanwhile in a frying pan, heat 1 tbsp of oil and add in the garlic. Cooking for a few minutes before adding in the celery, grated carrot and bread crumbs._

_6. Take the cashews out and once they are cool enough, place them in a food bag and bash them into pieces with a rolling pin or wooden spoon. Turn to oven up to about 220 degrees c or gas mark 7._

_7. Add the cashews, nutmeg and onion powder to the frying pan mixture and once mixed in add the lentil mixture. Check your mixture for seasoning and leave to the side._

_8. Prepare a sandwich tin with non-stick parchment paper and put the mixture into the tin. Give the tin a good shake to get it into all the corners._

_9. Place on the middle shelf of the oven for about 25- 30 minutes. When ready take out the roast and leave on a cooling rack for 5- 10 minutes. I often leave the roast in the parchment paper._

_10. Slice the roast and serve it with a selection of veg and an onion gravy. You may find at times the slices will crumble slightly but it will not distract from the eating pleasure._

**_Serving Suggestions_**

_I like to serve the roast with some green veg, mini roasted potatoes and onion gravy. For a special occasion I make vegan cheezy cauliflower for an extra side dish._

**_Versatile Mix_**

_The lentil and cashew mix can be used for the filling plant-based sausage rolls or formed into patties for burgers. You can bake the dish in ready formed slices in the oven and it should freeze easily. It is easy to change the dish with the types of nuts you use and play about with the spice mix. I like to add fresh sage to the roast or some dried herbs._
