title: Fake Bacon or Facon
author: Graham

---
_I love a facon roll with some coffee as a weekend breakfast treat. It is easy to create fake bacon with aubergine, pressed tofu or mushrooms and a quick marinade. Portobello mushrooms are great to making slices and chestnut mushrooms work well for creating facon bits. Tempeh is another good option for facon. It can be marinated or bought pre-flavoured. I have seen recipes which use rice paper or coconut flakes. The marinade below uses liquid smoke but it not essential._

_Preparation: 10 - 15 mins_

_Cooking: 15 – 30 mins_

**_Ingredients for the marinade_**

_2 tbsp of oil_

_1 tbsp of maple syrup_

_1 tsp of smoked paprika_

_1 tsp of garlic granules_

_I tsp of onion granules_

_1 tsp of liquid smoke_

_1 tsp of soy sauce_

_1 tsp of apple cider vinegar_

_Salt and pepper to season_

**_Plant-based choices_**

_2 large portobello mushrooms, sliced_

_200g of chestnut mushrooms, sliced_

_1 aubergine, sliced_

_200g of pressed tofu, sliced or crumbled_

**_Method:_**

_Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees c or gas mark 6 and prepare your ingredients for your marinade. You can adjust the flavours to make it sweeter, smokier or salty._

_Prepare your mushrooms or aubergine by slicing and coating in the marinade. With the tofu, you need to press it first, then cut into slices or you can crumble it to create bacon bits. The sliced tofu benefits from having a little time to marinate._

_Place your marinated facon on an oven tray lined with baking parchment. Put the tray on the middle shelf. It will take between 15 – 30 mins to cook. After 15 mins, keep checking until it has crisped up._

_The fake bacon makes a good brunch dish, added to a salad, wraps or in dirty fries. Below, I used chestnut mushrooms to make facon for a spaghetti dish with a cashew cheeze sauce._
