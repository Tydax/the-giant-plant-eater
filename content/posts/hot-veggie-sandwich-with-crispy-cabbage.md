title: Hot Veggie Sandwich with Crispy Cabbage
author: Graham

---
_This is another sandwich inspired by Albi’s in Edinburgh. The Leith based gourmet sandwich café use thick focaccia bread to make delicious hot sangers. The vegan fillings are imaginative and show a great understanding of flavour and textures. It is through them, I discovered charred cabbage as a filling. The contents of the fridge and the larder influence the filling. So, play around with what you have. For this sandwich I used focaccia bread from a local artisan bakery. It was a treat to buy the bread. The crispy onions are ready prepared in a container and are great to add to a number of dishes._

_Next, take your cabbage and cut the wedge in half. Place the wedges in boiling salted water and cook for around 5 minutes._

_Take the cabbage out and let it drain whilst you heat some oil in a frying pan. Add in mushrooms for a couple of minutes before adding the cabbage, paprika, garlic and onion powder. Season well with pepper and salt._ 

_Cook the cabbage until it starts to char, and the mushrooms are browning. Squeeze some lemon juice over the cabbage. Take the pan of the heat._

_The cooked aubergines can be taken out when ready and you can start of assemble your sandwich._

_On the bottom half of your bread put some siracha mayo before adding the mushrooms, aubergine, crispy onions and charred cabbage._

_On the top layer spread with some mayo and lay down some pickle slices. Assemble both sides together and cut in half before serving._

_This may appear like a lunchtime treat but with the addition of a side this big sanger makes a great dinner._
