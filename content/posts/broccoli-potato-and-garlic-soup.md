title: 'Broccoli, Potato and Garlic Soup '

_I remember as a student attempting my first soup. My mother made them with ease, but my soup seemed to lack the body. I learnt that I needed a higher heat to infuse the veg into the stock. The recipe below needs a few ingredients to make a creamy and delicious soup. I spent some time sauteing the veg before adding the stock and at the end adding plenty of cracked pepper to enhance the flavour. It will keep for a few days in the fridge and is easy to freeze._

_Place on the lid and cook on a medium heat for about 20 minutes. Let the soup cool slightly, remove the bay leaves, and blend the soup using a stick blender. If you do not have a blender or a liquidizer, then you mash the soup together or pass it through a sieve._
