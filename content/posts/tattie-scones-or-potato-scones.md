_The great Scottish cooked breakfast is made up of many elements and the tattle scone takes it place proudly on the plate. You can buy them readily in most supermarkets, but they are worth making from scratch. It involves only a few ingredients and it is a good way to use up left over mashed potatoes. You can freeze the scones after making them._

_Makes around 6 scones_

_Preparation:_

_Preparing potatoes: 15 – 20 minutes_

_Assembling scones: 5 minutes_

_65g of plain flour_

_25g of margarine_

_½ tsp of salt_

_¼ tsp of baking powder_

**_Method:_**

_Combine the mashed potatoes with the salt, butter and baking powder. Add enough flour until you end up with a dough. You can also buy prepared vegan mashed potatoes from most supermarkets._

_Flour a surface and roll out the dough to about ½ cm in thickness and cut into wedges._

_Heat a heavy frying pan or griddle to a medium heat and grease the surface with some margarine._

_Cook for about 3 minutes on each side until they are a golden-brown colour._

**_Variations_**

_I have also made these scones using sweet potatoes and the results were very good. Although there are traditionally used in a hearty breakfast, they also make an excellent lighter breakfast. You could top them with some sautéed mushrooms, tomatoes, vegan haggis slices or vegan strips such as tempeh._
