_There is an enormous rise in plant-based food available in most supermarkets. They often base themselves as substitutes to meat. For the following recipe, I have used southern style no-chicken tenders._

_The results were good, and my partner appreciated my efforts._

_The tortilla has a single cut from the centre to edge to allow the folding. I use this method for the Mexican folded tortilla recipe on this blog._

_The fillings for each layer can be easily changed to allow you to play with flavours and textures._

**_Serves: 2- 4_**

**_Preparation: 5 minutes_**

**_Cooking: 20 minutes (this will depend on the type of no- chicken you use)_**

**_Ingredients:_**

_4 tortillas_

_No-chicken tenders, pieces, nuggets, or strips_

_Vegan mayo (shop bought or check the recipe in my blog)_

_Siracha mayo_

_Large pickle slices or whole pickles_

_Crispy, dried onions_

_2 red onions, peeled and sliced_

_1 clove of garlic, crushed_

_50g of cherry or baby plum tomatoes, sliced into halves_

_1 tbsp of oil_

_Salt and pepper to season_

_80g of vegan cheeze that melts, grated_

**_Method:_**

_Prepare your no-chicken pieces according to the instructions._

_Meanwhile in a frying pan, heat the oil and fry off the red onions for a few minutes before adding the garlic. As the onions start to soften add in the tomatoes. Cook until the onions are soft and start to carmelise. Season well with salt and pepper._

_Next, take one wrap at a time and make a cut from the centre to the edge. The fillings are placed in four parts._

_In the bottom left, place some sliced pickles, squeeze over some siracha mayo, and then sprinkle a little crispy onion. In the top left put some red onions and tomatoes. For the top right sprinkle some grated cheeze. In the bottom right, spread some vegan mayo and place some sliced no-chicken tenders on top._

_Your wrap is ready to be folded and toasted. Have a non-stick frying pan or griddle heated and toast the tortillas for a few minutes on each side._

_Serve your wraps on their own or with a side salad._
