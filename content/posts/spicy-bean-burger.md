title: Spicy Bean Burger
author: Graham

---
_The spicy bean burger is a classic veggie burger. I remember serving them during my days of working in the Wimpy which then became Burger King. The burger is easy to make with ingredients you often have in your store cupboard. The mix will keep for a few days in the fridge and would freeze well._

_Mix the beans with carrots, chilli and onion. Season the mix and chill it in the fridge for at least 30 mins. This will help the mixture to hold together to form patties._

_Whilst the mix is chilling you can prepare 3 shallow trays or dishes. Place the flour, panko and seasoned flour in the separate trays._
