title: 'Spinach, Pea and Mushroom Risotto '
author: Graham

_Risotto often features in our house during the week. It is easily flavoured in a variety of ways and lends itself to using what you find in the fridge. It does require a little love as you pour over the stock in small quantities and stir gently. But the love and attention are worth it._

_In a traditional risotto you would have a hard cheese like parmesan, but you easily substitute this with nutritional yeast and some parm (a blend of cashew nuts and nutritional yeast). I haven’t added any white wine to this dish and use lemon juice to add some sharpness._

_2. Add another tbsp of oil into the pan and fry off the chopped onion and I clove of crushed garlic. Once the onion starts to soften, add in the rice and stir through for about a couple of minutes. Keep an eye so the rice does not stick and burn._

_3. Gradually add the stock and stir the rice mixture frequently over a medium heat. Keep repeating this process as the stock absorbs into the rice. The mixture should appear creamy and the rice should be tender_

**_Variety Dish_**

_It is easy to change this dish and use the ingredients in your house for inspiration. You can change the flavour base using a mix of fresh and chopped tinned tomatoes. Risotto works well as a starter and if you have some left overs you can create a version of arancini. You can buy vegan 'Parmesan' cheese in blocks or grated to use to flavour the dish._
