_I love katsu curry and it often appears on the menu for a midweek dinner. You can use the delicous katsu curry sauce as a topping for a burger and pour the extra sauce over a side of fries or wedges. It is a great way to serve a humble burger._

_For the recipe below, I made my side dish with unpeeled sliced potatoes. They were par boiled before frying them off with some garlic and herbs. There is something satisfying about chips ‘n’ curry sauce and this is a good take on the classic dish for having at the side of your burger._

_For the burger you can use a breaded veggie burger or no-chicken burger. You might want to use slices of aubergine and sweet potato which are shallowed fried with panko breadcrumbs instead of the burger._

_The curry sauce is made from blocks of concentrated curry which are easily bought from Asian and regular supermarkets._

_4- 6 potatoes, cut into thick slices_

_If you are using cooked potatoes, you can skip out this step. You just need to slice them._

_Slice your potatoes into thick slices and place in salted water and bring to the boil. Keep it on a high heat and cook for around 15 minutes until the potatoes have softened. Drain the potatoes and return to the hob with the lid on. Move the pan briskly so any water that is left is absorbed and the potatoes fluff slightly._

_In a frying pan, heat the oil and add in the garlic, rosemary, and onion powder. Place the sliced potatoes and cook for around 6 mins on each side. Allowing the potatoes to crisp._

_When they are ready, transfer to a plate with some kitchen paper to absorb any excess oil. Season the potatoes well with salt._
