_Nachos are a pub classic and are great for sharing when out having drinks with friends or family. I like to make this at home when I have left over chilli. For this recipe I use a plant-based cheeze sauce which brings the different elements together._

_Assembling and cooking the nachos under the grill does not take long. You will spend your time creating the cheeze sauce, salsa, refried beans and guacamole._

**_Making the Cheeze Sauce_**

_This sauce can be used to create a big range of dishes from classic cauliflower cheeze to topping a burger or making a comforting macaroni cheeze. It will keep in the fridge in an air-tight container for a few days._
