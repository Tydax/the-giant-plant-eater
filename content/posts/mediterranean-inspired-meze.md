title: Mediterranean Inspired Mezé

---
_There is a sense of informality that comes from sharing small dishes of food. I love to create sharing plates for my partner, family, and friends._

_You can play about with the selection of dishes and add prepared delicacies from local delis and supermarkets._

_It is quick to prepare with a mixture of cold and warm dishes. I have included some dishes that you might serve as part of your mezé_

**_Cous Cous_**

_It is easy and quick to prepare dried cous cous. I often buy a flavoured packet to prepare. When following the instructions, I prefer to bring the water to boil in a pan before adding the cous cous. Then I take the pan of the heat, give it a quick stir before putting on the lid. You only need to wait 5 minutes for it to be ready. Take a fork to fluff up the grains._

_You can add toasted almonds and chopped dried fruits such as apricots to the cous cous if you wish._

**_Baba Ganoush_**

_This aubergine dish is easy to prepare and will keep well in the fridge._

**_Preparation: 10 - 15 minutes_**

**_Cooking: 15 – 20 minutes_**

**_Ingredients_**

_1 aubergine, cut into rounds_

_2 tbsp of tahini_

_2 – 3 tbsp of oil for roasting_

_½ lemon_

_2 cloves of garlic_

_Salt to season_

**_Method:_**

_Pre-heat your oven to 180 for a fan or gas mark 6._

_Slice your aubergine and salt them. Lay the slices on absorbent kitchen roll to help remove some of the moisture for about 10 minutes._

_Place the aubergine slices onto a baking tray and brush them generously with the oil._

_Bake the slices for around 15 minutes. The aubergine should be soft, and the skin should come away easily. Let the aubergine cool slightly before removing the skin._

_In a food processor or in a bowl with a stick blender, place the aubergine, tahini, crushed garlic, some salt, and the juice from the lemon._

_Blitz the mixture until it forms a soft paste. Check for seasoning. You can add a little more salt, tahini, and lemon juice._

_Serve the dip in a bowl._

**_Flat Breads_**

_You probably want to allow 2- 3 pitta breads per person. There are a range of different flat breads out there that you can add to your meze. To keep them warm, wrap the breads in foil._

**_Vegan Soured Yogurt and Tzatziki_**

_In a bowl put in some plain vegan yogurt and add a little apple cider vinegar or some lemon juice to sour the mix. You only need a little apple cider vinegar, probably around a tsp for a small bowl. To the dish add some salt._

_To make **Tzatziki**, peel and chop some cucumber to add to the yogurt or you add flavour to the yogurt by adding some chopped **fresh mint**._

**_Prepared Dishes form Delis and Supermarkets_**

_I have made my own falafels but it easy to buy a selection to warm up at home. There are some wonderful, prepared deli items to choose from marinated beetroot to stuffed vine leaves._
