title: 'Herby Cobbler and Lentil Stew '
author: Graham

---
_This is a satisfying dish during autumn and winter. It works well for sharing with others and is easily adapted. At the base is a warming stew which is topped with herby scones and baked in the oven. For this recipe I have made a quick green lentil stew, but you could change for some jackfruit or seasonal veggies. It requires a little preparation but needs little attention whilst it cooks and bakes in the oven._

_The herby scones have nutritional yeast and some vegan cheese that melts. You can add more yeast in and leave out the cheese to make the scones._

_I have used a casserole dish that I can use on the hob and in the oven. This allows me to prepare everything in one pot. You can also use a lasagne style dish and prepare the stew in a pan._

**_Ingredients for the Herby Scones_**

_225g self-raising flour_

_1 tsp of baking powder_

_Pinch of salt_

_Pinch of cayenne or paprika (optional)_

_2 tsp of dried mixed herbs_

_55g of margarine or vegan butter_

_100ml of plant-based milk such as soy or oat_

_100g of grated vegan cheese that melts, such as Smoked Applewood_

_3 tbsp of nutritional yeast_

**_Preparing the Scones_**

_In a large bowl mix the flour with the baking powder and spice. Then rub together the flour and margarine until it resembles breadcrumbs. Add in the dried herbs, nutritional yeast and 90g of the vegan cheese._

_On a floured board place the dough and roll out to about ½ cm in thickness. Using a scone cutter make around 6 – 8 scones. If you do not have a cutter a glass tumbler will work well._

**_Assembling the Herby Cobbler_**

_Check the stew for seasoning and if needed use the cornflour to thicken the stew. Mix the cornflour with a little cold water before adding to the stew._

_Arrange the scones on top of the stew, brush with a little plant-based milk and place in a hot oven for about 20 minutes._

_Remove from the oven and add the remaining vegan cheese and cook for around 10 more minutes. Allowing the cheese to melt._
