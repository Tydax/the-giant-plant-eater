_To help in the journey of plant-based cooking, it is good to have a few handy supplies. The list below gives some guidance on what can be helpful. You might choose products which are seasonal, organic or ethically produced._

**_Tinned Products and Cartons_**

![](/content/images/img_20200830_184740.jpg)

_The great thing about tins and some cartons is that they can be kept ambient and have a long shelf life. They hold the nutritional value of the food and allow for the making of quick and easy meals. I usually keep in my cupboards the following:_

_Coconut milk and cartons of coconut cream_

_Chopped tomatoes, cartons of passata_

_Jackfruit in brine, which is becoming more available in supermarkets. You can buy it readily in specialist stores, health food shops and in Asian supermarkets. It can be bought flavoured and works well in stews, for burgers and shreds easily to create making pulled jackfruit or vegan ‘duck’ pancakes._

_Pulses – kidney beans, black beans, chickpeas, lentils_

**_Nutritional Yeast_**

_This is a dry inactive form of yeast and adds a cheesy nutty flavour to dishes. You can sprinkle it on top of a salad or add it to some pasta. It is often used to create a ‘cheese’ sauce._

**_Herbs and Spices_**

_A good selection of dried herbs and spices are essential, and the following are helpful:_

· _mixed herbs, bay leaves, oregano, coriander, rosemary, sage_

· _chilli powder, chilli flakes, cinnamon, curry powder, garlic granules, ground coriander, ground cumin, ground ginger, garam masala, onion powder, paprika, smoked paprika, turmeric_

_Fresh herbs, ginger and chillies are good to have and you might have space to grow your own._

**_Pulses and Nuts_**

_Dried green and red lentils_

_Cashew are a staple in vegan cooking, but a range of nuts are great to adding to dishes from almonds, walnuts, pistachios and pine nuts_

_See tinned products_

**_Plant-Based Dairy Alternatives_**

_For substitutes for milk you will find a wide choice. Soy plant -based drink is a good for general use and makes great vegan mayonnaise. Almond is good for general baking and cooking._

_Vegan margarine is easily found and brands such as Flora and Vitalite are widely available. I often choose to buy Flora Buttery._

_Sliced and blocks of vegan cheese are good for adding into burgers, salads and sandwiches. You can make your own cheese sauce for topping burgers, mixing with pasta and creating vegetable bakes. There are a number of artisan plant-based makers who make alternatives to cow, sheep and goat cheeses._

**_Oils and Vinegars_**

_Sunflower or vegetable oil is great to general cooking. Both oils do not have strong flavours and are good for using at a high heat. It is great for frying, roasting, baking and creating homemade hummus or mayonnaise._

_Rapeseed oil is a good general oil for some shallow frying or making a dressing._

_Olive oil and virgin oil are good for dressings and as a dip for bread._

_Coconut oil is good for frying, roasting and baking._

_Apple cider vinegar and white wine vinegar are great for making mayo, dressing and when you want to sour something._

**_Veggies, Fruit and Fungi_**

_It is great to have a selection of fresh veg to create a variety of dishes. You can keep your pantry or fridge stocked with root and Mediterranean veggies._

_A stock of potatoes and carrots are great. They combine well to form a cheese sauce and grated carrot works well for making nut roasts and burgers._

_Cauliflower is a wonderful vegetable to marinating, adding to curries and stir fries._

_Aubergines can be marinated to create steaks or ‘facon’. It can be roasted with pepper, mashed down to make a delicious spread called Avjar._

_Mushrooms can be used to create sauces, soups or added in a pasta dishes, risottos and stir-fries. Some types work well for creating ‘facon’ or pulled mushrooms. Quorn is based fungi and has recently launched some vegan products._

_Frozen peas, they make a fantastic pesto and perfect for adding to risottos and stir-fried dishes._

_Jackfruit – see tinned products_

_Lemons and limes for adding sharpness to dishes or creating hummus or guacamole_

**_Sauces and Condiments_**

_Light and dark soy sauce are fantastic for adding flavour and colour to a dish._

_Liquid smoke helps to give a smoky flavour and is great in a marinade._

Gravy browning works well when adding colour to a dish.

_A stock of BBQ, Ketchup, Sriracha, Hot Sauce and Siracha Mayo._

_Vegan Mayo, it is easy to make your own, but a jar is handy._

_Marmite or Vegemite, which can be used to add depth to a dish in small quantities. I realise that people either love or hate it._

**_Vegan Stock_**

_There is a wide range of stock cubes, bullion and liquid stock on the market to chose from. I like the vegan stock from Swiss Marigold. When using stock be aware of the salt levels and adjust your seasoning when making different meals._

**_Rice, Pasta and Noodles_**

_A selection of different types of rice are good to have at hand. You will find that dried pasta generally contains no egg and that many dried noodles have no eggs in them. Rice noodles generally are vegan friendly._

**_Flour and Baking Products_**

_A supply of plain and self-raising flour allows you to create sauces, casseroles, make fluffy pancakes and plant -based baking. Cornflour is useful for thickening sauces, gravy and stews. Baking powder and bicarbonate will help you to make great vegan bakes and other dishes. I occasionally use cream of tartar when baking. They are great variety of types of flour out there from bread flour to rye and spelt._

**_Maple Syrup_**

_It is a good alternative to honey and is great for making dressings, ‘facon’ and adding to pancakes._

**_Tofu_**

_Pressed blocks of tofu are fantastic for marinating and can be used to create and alternative to scrambled eggs. It works well in stir fries and curries._

**_Tempeh_**

_Tempeh is made from fomented soya beans and usually comes in a block or strips. You can buy it flavoured or marinate it at home as it often used as an alternative to bacon._

**_Ready Prepared, Meat Substitutes and Processed Foods_**

_There has been a recent explosion in plant- based products that are available from burgers to sausages and vegan mince. You can pick up a vegan pizza or ready meal for ease and convenience. In supermarkets you should also check out the free-from section, where you can pick up biscuits, cakes and alternatives to custard and pouring cream._

_Most shop bought puff and short crust pastry contains no dairy and is fantastic to have for baking. There are a huge variety of food out there from dried pasta to most breads that are vegan friendly. Have a look at online to find some surprising foods._

_There are many wines and beers that are suitable for vegans._

_It is good to check the label of products._
