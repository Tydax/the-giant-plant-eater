title: 'Vegan Scottish Breakfast '
author: Graham

---
_The full breakfast is a popular dish people associated with Britain and Ireland. It has variations around the country and is sometimes referred to as the ‘fry up.’ I have created below a variation of the Scottish full breakfast. This is a dish to have occasionally and makes a good weekend brunch. When cooking, I heat the oven as a space to keep things warm as I tackle the next part of the breakfast. I haven’t quite managed the skills that I see in a local café where they pull together a veggie breakfast in one pan in a matter of minutes. You can choose to have ‘meat’ substitutes or not on your breakfast plate. It is also easy to bake or grill most of the elements for the breakfast instead of frying._

**_What to put on your plate?_**

_These are some of the elements, I might include on the plate. It does involve juggling items and their cooking times to pull everything together._

_Tattie Scones_

_These traditional potato scones are easy to make or your can buy them form the supermarket. I would allow 2 scones per person. A recipe for scones can be found on my blog. You might start off by boiling some potatoes near the beginning to make the scones if you don’t have any left-over mash. It is now possible to buy ready-made mash that is suitable for vegans._

_Baked Beans_

_I generally buy a tin of budget baked beans and cook them for a long period. This allows the sauce to thicken and the beans to soften. I usually start them off at the beginning of the breakfast with a high heat to warm them up and then turning it down low. Just before serving I like to add a knob of margarine to stir into the beans. Around half a tin of beans for 2 people._

_Vegan Sausages_

_There are a wide variety of vegan sausages to buy from supermarkets. You can easily cook them in the frying pan and keep then in the oven to keep warm as you prepare more parts. I enjoy the Cauldron brand and like the taste and texture. If you have time you can make sausages perhaps using chickpeas or lentils as a base. Depending on the size, allow 1- 2 sausages per person._

_Tomatoes_

_The tomatoes can be started in the pan with other items for the breakfast. I often choose small whole tomatoes on the vine and cooking them with plenty of garlic and seasoning before placing in the oven as the rest of the dish comes together._

_Facon or Vegan ‘Bacon’_

_You can buy flavoured strips of tempeh, marinate slices of tofu or aubergine by using liquid smoke and paprika to crisp up in the pan and bake in the oven. On the plate I would add a couple of slices per person._

_Mushrooms_

_I like mushrooms that have been seasoned well and sautéed in garlic. Towards the end of the cooking you can add a little vegan margarine to add to their flavour and to help them become golden in colour. You might use 80-100g of mushrooms for 2 people._

_Toast_

_Take your preference of bread and add it to the breakfast. I usually use sourdough bread and prepare one slice per person._

_Veggie Haggis_

_It is possible to buy this in slices, but you can use part of a complete haggis. It you are visiting Scotland you can but tinned veggie haggis in tourist shops. The advantage of tinned haggis is the shelf life. You can cook the slices in the pan for a few minutes each side or microwave a small amount of haggis. I would generally have one slice per person._

_Scrambled Tofu_

_In a breakfast you would traditionally get a fried egg and maybe a poached egg. For your big plate, a side serving of scrambled tofu is great. I have a recipe in my blog._

_Sauce_

_A hearty breakfast comes usually comes with a choice of ketchup or brown sauce. I prefer brown sauce but will sometimes add in some Sriracha or Sriracha Mayo as a condiment._

**_Extras to Consider_**

_Veggie Breakfast Pack or Veggie Black Pudding from Simon Howie_

_The above products are suitable for vegans and fit well into a classic full Scottish. The breakfast pack consists of a veggie link sausage, veggie square sausage and veggie black pudding. I have tried out the pack with my partner. It works well for a hearty breakfast. The Real Lancashire Black Pudding Company also make a vegan black pudding, or you might want to try the V-Pud._

_Spinach_

_I love some wilted spinach as part of a breakfast. I like to cook it with plenty of garlic and season it well._

_Potatoes_

_If you have some left-over potatoes, you can easily fry them up with the breakfast or you could add in some hash browns. If you are feeling adventurous, then a potato waffle is an excellent addition to a breakfast._

Avacado 

You can add some slices of avacado or mash an avacado with some lime, salt and chilli flakes as a side dish. 

_Breakfast Rolls_

_This takes elements of the breakfast and serves them up in a soft morning bread roll. Some veggie sausages or ‘facon’ would work well in a roll but you can add in elements from tattie scones to mushrooms. The traditional sauces would be ketchup or brown sauce._

Heading Out 

I love to make brunch but also love heading out. The vegan breakfast or brunch is appearing more. The picture below is from the Canvas Cafe, Brick Lane, London.
