title: Cheezy Fondue
author: Graham

---
_This is a fabulous retro shared party dish. It can be served as a starter or as a main. I do remember in the 90’s going to friends for a fondue party. I was a vegetarian at the time and a classic cheese fondue was a treat. A few years back, I acquired a fondue set and it lay at the back of the cupboard waiting to spring into action. As I now explore the world of plant-based cooking I wanted to try out a vegan fondue. You do not need a fondue set to do this, but it helps to keep the dish warm as you share. You can use a heavy based pan and some forks for dipping. It would be easy to keep the dish warm by using a food warmer as an alternative._

_The basis of this dish involves cashews, potatoes, and nutritional yeast. To this you add some vegan white wine. Many supermarkets have clear labelling on their own wine which will help you chose a suitable vegan bottle._

**_Preparation: 15 minutes_**

**_Cooking: 30 minutes_**

**_Serves: 4- 6_**

**_Ingredients for the Fondue_**

_250ml of raw cashews_

_250ml of soy milk_

_250ml of white wine_

_1 large potato, peeled and chopped into quarters_

_1 garlic clove_

_2 tbsp of white miso paste_

_3 tbsp of nutritional yeast_

_1 tbsp of Dijon mustard_

_1 tbsp of lemon juice_

_1 tsp of onion powder_

_1 – 2 tsp of cornflour_

_2 bay leaves_

_Salt and pepper to season_

**_Vegetables and Bread to Dip_**

_Cooked baby potatoes_

_Roasted sweet potatoes_

_Roasted veg such as courgette and peppers_

_Cubes of bread_

**_Method:_**

_In a pan of boiling water place your potato and cashew nuts. Cook them together on a high heat for about 20 mins._

_Place the cooked potatoes and cashews in a food processor with the miso, garlic, mustard, lemon, and onion powder. Blitz the mixture together. If you do not have a food processor you can still blend the mixture with a hand-held stick._

_Slowly combine the paste with the plant-based milk until you have a smooth mixture._

_Next heat the mixture with the white wine in the fondue pot or heavy-based saucepan on the hob. Add in plenty of salt and black pepper before heating the sauce. At this point you can add a little cornflour mixed with cold water to thicken the fondue._

_When ready, light your spirit burner for the fondue or you could use a food warmer with a pan. Have some bread, potatoes, and veggies ready to dip in._

**_Variations_**

_You can swap the wine for some cider or beer to make your fondue. When making it you can add in a little cooked carrot or some turmeric to enrich the colour. Any leftover mixture will keep in the fridge for a few days. It is easy to reduce the quantity to make a smaller fondue. You might want to add in some vegan stock to the dish to add to the flavour and add in a little less plant-based milk._
