_A great way to enhance a dish is by adding a sauce or gravy. Most are easy to make and will keep for a few days in the fridge and can be frozen. The humble onion is the star for many of these and it is an essential item in the larder. You can also buy some instant gravy mixes, which are handy as a standby._

**_Onion Gravy_**

_This is a simple gravy to create and makes a great accompaniment to traditional bangers and mash, a tasty nut roast or veggie haggis wellington. It requires a little time to cook the onions before adding some flavoured stock. The gravy will keep for a few days in the fridge and easily freezes._

**_Serves: 2- 4_**

**_Preparation: 10 minutes_**

**_Cooking: 20 minutes_**

**_Ingredients:_**

_2 medium sized onions, chopped finely_

_1 clove of garlic, minced_

_300 ml of vegan stock_

_1 tbsp of vegetable oil_

_I tbsp of soy sauce_

_1 – 2 tsp of cornflour_

_1 bay leaf (optional)_

_Salt and pepper to season_

**_Method:_**

_Heat the oil in the pan before adding in the chopped onions and crushed garlic. Cook on a gentle heat to allow the onions to soften and slowly start to caramelise._

_Next add in the stock, bay leaves and soy sauce. Cook over a gentle heat for around 10 minutes. Check for seasoning._

_To thicken the gravy, mix your cornflour with a little cold water. Add the cornflour mix to gravy and cook through. You can adjust the thickness by adding more cornflour._

**_Variations_**

_At the beginning of cooking, when the onions are starting to caramelise, you can add a small glass of red wine or a little port. Let the alcohol cook off before adding your stock. You can also add a little flour to the caramelised onions before adding the stock. This will help to thicken the gravy._

**_Red Onion Gravy_**

_This rich gravy goes well with a nut roast and packs flavour with the slowly cooked red onions. You can substitute the red wine for with a teaspoon of red wine vinegar. A spoon of cranberry or red currant jelly will add some sweetness to the gravy._

**_Serves: 2- 4_**

**_Preparation: 5 -10 minutes_**

**_Cooking: 20 minutes_**

**_Ingredients:_**

_2 medium sized red onions, chopped finely_

_1 clove of garlic, crushed_

_150ml of red wine_

_250ml of vegan stock_

_1tbsp of vegetable oil_

_1tbsp of soy sauce_

_1tsp of brown sugar_

_1 bay leaf_

_1 tsp of cornflour or 1 tbsp of plain flour_

**_Method:_**

_Heat the oil in the pan and gentle fry off the onions and garlic. Add in the sugar to help with the caramelisation. When the onions are softened and caramelise add in the red wine._

_Simmer the onions with the wine for about 5- 10 minutes before adding the bay leaf, stock, soy, and seasoning. Cook for a further 5- 10 minutes._

_Near the end of the cooking, if you need to thicken the gravy add a little cornflour mixed with cold water. You can add a little flour at the beginning of cooking when you caramelised the onions. This will also help to thicken the sauce._

**_Tomato Sauce_**

_A rich tomato sauce is great addition to pasta but also works well to pour over a vegan wellington, plant-based sausages, or veggie roast. It uses ingredients that are often in the larder and is easy to make. I like to add a little chilli powder to give it a gentle heat. You can store it in the fridge for a few days or freeze it for later. If you have some fresh herbs in the house, you can add it to the sauce or choose a pinch of dry herbs._

**_Serves: 3- 4_**

**_Preparation: 10 minutes_**

**_Cooking: 20 minutes_**

**_Ingredients:_**

_1 can of chopped tomatoes or 1 carton of passata_

_300ml of vegan stock_

_1 onion, chopped finely_

_2 cloves of garlic, minced_

_1 tbsp of oil_

_1 tbsp of vegan margarine (optional)_

_1 tsp of dried herbs such as oregano or thyme_

_1 tsp of chilli powder_

_Salt and pepper to season_

**_Method:_**

_Heat the oil in the pan and add in the onions then the garlic. Fry the onions until they have become soft._

_Next add in the tomatoes, stock, herbs, chilli, and seasoning. Bring up the heat and as the mixture begins to bubble. Turn the heat down and let it simmer for about 10 – 15 minutes. This will let the sauce thicken._

_Add in the end of cooking you can add in a little vegan margarine. This will help to produce to produce a velvety sauce._

**_Variations:_**

_You can create a smoother sauce by using a hand blender to blitz the sauce. The flavour can be changed with different herbs or adding a little more chilli powder._

**_Cheeze Sauce_**

_There are many ways to make a plant-based sauce. Using some nutritional yeast and mustard helps to create the taste. It is possible to make a classic sauce and substitute the dairy for some soy milk, vegan margarine, then adding in the nutritional yeast and mustard. To this you can add garlic powder and onion powder. There is also an increasing amount of plant-based cheezes which melt and can be added to the sauce. My partner creates sauces using cashew nuts, which are soaked and blitzed to help create a creamy sauce. The recipe below uses potatoes and carrots to make the sauce. I feature the recipe in the blog for cauliflower cheeze and nachos._

**_Serves: 3-4_**

**_Preparation: 15 minutes_**

**_Ingredients:_**

_250 g of peeled potatoes, cut into chunks_

_120 g of peeled carrots, cut into chunks_

_100 ml of water_

_60 ml of vegetable oil_

_35 g of nutritional yeast_

_1 tsp of lemon juice_

_1 tsp of mustard_

_1 tsp of salt_

_½ tsp of garlic powder_

_½ tsp of onion powder_

**_Method:_**

_Peel, chop and cook your potatoes and carrots. I use a covered dish in the microwave for this, but you can easily boil them._

_Place the cooked potatoes, carrots, and the rest of the cheese sauce ingredients into a large jug. Using a stick blender combine the ingredients until it forms a thick sauce. Taste and check for seasoning._

_The sauce will keep for a few days in the fridge. It is great for making nachos, cauliflower cheeze, topping a veggie burger or mixing with some pasta._

**_White Sauce_**

_A classic white sauce or bechamel is great for making lasagne, a creamy vegetable pie or adding some nutritional yeast and mustard to create a cheeze sauce. You can add a little white wine or add some in some sauteed mushrooms to create enrich sauce. To make this sauce you simply substitute the dairy for plant-based alternatives. I prefer soy milk for making this sauce. Infusing your plant-based milk with an onion, cloves and a bay leaf helps to create flavour, but you can miss out this step._

_For making a quick sauce, I skip making a roux. I place all the ingredients into a pan and heat gently whilst whisking with a balloon whisk. This ensures you get no lumps as the sauce combines._

**_Preparation: 25 minutes_**

**_Cooking: 10 minutes_**

**_Serves: 4_**

**_Ingredients:_**

_500ml of plant-based milk_

_1 onion, halved_

_1 bay leaf_

_2 cloves_

_50g of plain flour_

_50g of margarine_

_Salt and pepper to season_

_½ tsp of grated nutmeg (optional)_

**_Method:_**

_Place the plant-based milk, onion studded with the cloves and the bay leaf into a pan. Bring it gently to the boil and then remove from the heat. Allow the flavours to infuse for 20 minutes._

_When the plant-based milk is ready you can make your roux. In another pan melt the margarine and whisk in the flour, a little a time. It will form together as a paste and you cook it together for 2 minutes._

_Remove the onion and bay leaf from the plant-based milk. Then slowly add it to the roux, mixing it together continuously to form the sauce. Cook the sauce for about 5 – 10 minutes, until it has thickened. Add in some fresh grated nutmeg and season well with salt and pepper._

**_Some Tips_**

_You may end up with some lumps in your sauce but if you keep whisking over a gentle heat, this will help to mix them in. If you have a lot of lumps, then pushing your sauce through a sieve will help._
