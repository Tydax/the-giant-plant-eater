author: Graham

_Frozen peas are a staple, and they make a perfect side dish or combined to create a zingy pesto or added to a risotto. They make a vibrant and fresh soup, combined with a little mint and some potatoes to add body to the soup._

_It is easy to make, stores well in the fridge and it suitable for freezing. It uses ingredients that you often have in the house with the addition of a little fresh mint._

**_Preparation: 5 – 10 minutes_**

**_Cooking: 20 – 25 minutes_**

**_Serves: 2- 4_**

_Bring the soup up to a high heat and cook for around 15 – 20 minutes. The potatoes should be softened by then._

_You can put the soup into a liquidizer. I use a stick blender in the pan to quickly get the soup ready. You can choose how blended you want the soup. At the end, add a little more water and seasoning if necessary._

_Serve in bowls with some sprigs of mint to garnish._
