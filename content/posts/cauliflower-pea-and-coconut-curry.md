_The cauliflower is the star in this simple curry dish. It is easy to make and will keep in the fridge for a few days in a sealed container. The coconut milk adds to the flavour and mellows the curry spices. It is a great dinner for midweek and can be used alongside other dishes for a banquet of sharing dishes._
